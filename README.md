🏗️ Architecture
ATLAS integrates seamlessly with existing transformer models by replacing standard attention layers with enhanced blocks featuring:
# Core Integration
from atlastest import EnhancedATLASBlock, OptimizedATLASMetaController, HybridATLASAttention

# Enhanced transformer layer with ATLAS optimizations
atlas_block = EnhancedATLASBlock(config, layer_idx=0)
output, performance_metrics = atlas_block(hidden_states, input_ids=input_ids)

🔒 Dependencies
Important Notice: This demonstration depends on the proprietary atlastest module which contains our core optimization algorithms and is not publicly available for competitive reasons.
The atlastest module includes:

Advanced evolutionary sparsity algorithms
Proprietary security threat detection patterns
Hardware-aware optimization strategies
Real-time adaptive decision systems

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites
pip install torch>=2.0.0
pip install transformers>=4.30.0
pip install numpy>=1.21.0

Running the Demo

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/atlas.git
cd atlas


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the test (requires atlastest module):

python3 atlas_qwen_test.py


Note: The test will fail without the proprietary atlastest module. Contact us for enterprise licensing and access.
